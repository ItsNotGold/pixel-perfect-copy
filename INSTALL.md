### For iOS / iPadOS (using Safari)

On iOS, you can install the PWA to your Home Screen from the Safari browser.

1.  **Open in Safari**: Make sure you are viewing the application in the Safari browser. Other browsers on iOS do not support this feature.

2.  **Open the Share Menu**: Tap the "Share" icon at the bottom of the screen. It looks like a square with an arrow pointing upwards.

3.  **Find "Add to Home Screen"**: Scroll down the list of options and tap on **"Add to Home Screen"**.

4.  **Confirm the Name**: You can customize the name that will appear under the app icon on your home screen. The default name is "VerbFlow".

5.  **Tap "Add"**: Tap the "Add" button in the top-right corner.

The app will now appear on your Home Screen. You can launch it just like any other app.

### For Android (using Chrome)

On Android, Chrome makes it easy to install PWAs.

1.  **Open in Chrome**: Make sure you are viewing the application in the Google Chrome browser.

2.  **Look for the Install Banner**: A banner might automatically appear at the bottom of the screen prompting you to "Add VerbFlow to Home screen". If you see it, simply tap it.

3.  **Manual Installation (if no banner appears)**:
    *   Tap the **three-dot menu** icon in the top-right corner of the Chrome browser.
    *   A menu will appear. Look for the **"Install app"** or **"Add to Home screen"** option and tap it.

4.  **Confirm Installation**: A confirmation dialog will appear. Tap the **"Install"** button.

The app will be added to your app drawer and your home screen. It will function like a native application, separate from your browser.
